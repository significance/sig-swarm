Concerning the infeasibility of mining trojan chunks with excessively long matching bit sequences.

The distance function could be more subtle than simply matching nibbles. 

For instance, perhaps we could match bits, or otherwise define a mathematical transformation that will allow a less discrete scale to identifiy the similiarity of references.
