The concept of Trojan chunks by itself contradicts the assumption of network address chunk uniformity.

Imagine the situtation where a user is a supernode for receiving messages, this could be as simple as a highly popular blog application subscription service node that has hundreds of thousands of requests for subscriptions.

In this case the neighourhood surrounding the listening node would swell to have more chunks than any other neighbourhood.

This would then affect the neighbourhood depth, assuming that the storage size of the nodes

Because of this, we cannot assume network uniformity and must ensure that it is not an axiomatic foundation of any other reasoning, in particular that around the economics of incentives.

#### How is a Neighbourhood Depth Defined?

Number of connected peers
Depth of bit prefix of Trojan chunks
Cut off of distance of blocks requested
Disk size
