	// sig waterfall keys system
		// a top key is used to sign all other keys, signing keys is a top security activity
		// a top key will be used to sign bottom keys and then also to encrypt other bottom keys with DH/ring encryption to allow other keys to decrypt these keys
		// keys will be rotated based on blockchain blocks, this provides the means of consensus syncronisation of ephemeral keys without requiring linear temporal correlation
		// the security level of the key will be based on a combination of distance from the top key and this frequency of rotation
		// some keys may be deterministically generated from others, others may not be dependant on their need to be predicted or obscured from others
		// top keys will be protected with the upmost care, bottom keys may be retained in readable memory
		// top keys represent identity, bottom keys represent authorisation
		// this system of authorising transactions should then be transparently presented to the user using a sequence of more and less secure authorisation procedures that are based on knowledge known only to themselves
		// it is important to note that, while providing the upmost privacy and therefore inherently secrecy, this system also provides inherently attribution. it should be known without doubt that the owner or owners of these keys are without a doubt responsible for any activities undertaken by them. the proof of knowledge of the private component of key material used to perpetrate an activity represents irrefutable evidence of the potential involvement in the activity of those persons to whom that knowledge was known.
		// the question as to whether a allowing a monopoly on secrecy is something preferred or feasible to allow to those whom we award the honour of being responsible for keeping us happy, healthy, safe and prosperous is deferred to those of those whom deal with the beautiful whimsy of the metaphysical of conciousness, and not our spanner reality of numbers

		//ux considerations
			// for now, it would be best to aim for most to have a mobile phone wallet, they are pretty ubiquitous, kind of secure
			// it would be pretty trivial to come up with something hardware based that was a bit more known secure that had similar functionality eg. qr scanner / reader
			// i prefer this to bluetooth/serial because it reduces the possibilties of mitm. the device can **ONLY** produces sigs

		//ux methodology

			// key generator on phone signs bottom key from top key material stored in the phone
			// that key is then known to be valid/authorised for a set period of time
			// once the time is expired it is no longer treated as valid by applications interacting with that key material
			// key material may be revoked

				// dave join the bulletin board
				// dave adds identity key to bulletin board beacon chunk feed
				// now dave's messages are integrated into the bulletin board's aggregated feed
				// the feed is agregatted by agregattors
				// when a deterministic representation of the aggregation of certain set of feeds at a certain consensous point has been reached it is noted in the bos (Blockchain On Swarm)
