// given the building blocks to build an application, one can build anything
// but the paradigms are different, and we must humor that

// single owner chunk or soc - owned by one user and can only be authorised by them
// trojan chunks are anonymous messages sent to a neighbourhood and protected by cryptography
// [tbc] beacon chunks are deterministic chunks sent to neighbourhoods so that anyone can see them
// true chunks are chunks where the address is the bmt hash of their content

// SOC AXIOMS
	//A SOC CAN ONLY BE CREATED BY IT'S OWNER
	//AN OWNER CAN CREATE MULTIPLE SOCS WITH THE SAME IDENTIFIER
	//THE EXISTENCE OF A SOC CANNOT BE PROVEN
	//THE EXISTENSE OF A SOC PROVES THE OWNER HAS CREATED IT AT SOME POINT

// SOC ATTACK
	// A USER REPLACES A SOC UNDER THEIR CONTROL WITH A DIFFERENT SOC
	// ONLY POSSIBLE IF PRIVATE KEY MATERIAL KNOWN
	// BUT CANNOT TRUST THE HISTORY OF SOCS
	// EG. FOR WOF A USER MAY UNPIN OLD SOC AND REPIN NEW SOC WITH DIFFERENT CONTENT CHANGING THE CHAIN
	// THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY AT AN APPLICATION LEVEL TO MITIGATE THIS TO ENSURE A CLEAR HISTORY
	// EACH BLOCK SHOULD CONTAIN THE HASH OF THE PREVIOUS BLOCK
	// ALSO, AND MORE CRITICALLY, THE NOMINATING USER SHOULD SIGN THE HASH OF THE PAYLOAD OF THE SOC OF THEIR ACCEPTED NOMINEE TO GUARANTEE DOWNWARDS VALIDITY

// DISCOVERY
	// gateways must provide discovery
	// http discovery to be opt in DNS or IP (based on gateway mode)
	// should consider tor bridge nodes methodology to give access to gateways that are not known to firewall operators
	// gateways must be compensated
