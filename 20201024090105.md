### notes

paid pinning and unpinning and how all that works

pinning is a notion of data persistence within a certain timeframe
some data is ephemeral, and can be removed after some time

there are multiple ways to perceive this

all data should be treated initially as ephemeral because this optimises efficiency
all data should be treated initially as eternal because this deoptimises accidental loss of important data
all data should be retained because i love my bzz

no data should be thought of as becoming less public, once it is out it is gone

data encryption schemes should give consideration to the probability that they may become crackable as computation and technique improves

in general, data storage facilities become cheaper as they have slower retrieval times
a sensible scheme would therefore tend toward cheaper cold storage backups which may have slower retrieval or proofs, and more expensive quick access storage. but this is for in the future
for now it is likely to be a more linear market because it is simpler to implement in the short term
however perhaps it useful to retrieve and compress data, or build more complex indices to search it
which would represent a a virtualised version of this

### pinning methodologies

for now local vs. global pinning is treated as the same thing


Pin it forever
- pin it
- forget about it it is pinned for long enough

Pin it temporariliy
- pin it
- remember where it is
- unpin it

Pin the newest version
- pin it
- remember where it is
- retrieve it
- >> update it
- pin new version
- unpin old one
- remember where new one is
