By definition light clients must not store the usual neighbourhood of blocks.

If we presume that a light client is able to forward all blocks which are contained within a neighbourhood, it would be possible for that light client to check each and every block to see whether it is a Trojan block intended for that client.

__unsure__ Since push syncing will not require intermediary forwarding nodes, and pull syncing is sporadic based on retrieval, it is not certain that a node with address within the neighbourhood would receive the message given the current set of syncing behavoir.

*Smaller Neighbourhoods*

Another approach would be to designate each light client with a smaller pool of chunks that they would receive via push sync and then retain or discard. 

Are chunks arrivals timestamped, if so, this could also provide a means of narrowing down the messages.

I realise we are working at cross purposes here. On one hand we want it to be impossible to discern which chunk is a Trojan chunk, on the other hand we want to enable nodes to discern a subset of chunks to scan to limit the need to expend computational and bandwidth resources.
