title: Swapchat
---

Swapchat was an initial proof of concept application built on swarm to show how single owner chunks using uint indices could be used to create a private ephemeral chat channel between two participants using a shared feed.

In this *special case*, because the nature of the use of the shared feed is mutually co-operative, and any use other than the one expected simply breaks the application level protocol, it is ok to share the key. As detailed in [multi use of soc](), this is not normally the situation, and this requires us to ensure the secrecy of each private key and explore other strategies to have a shared channel. 

To make the process easier to understand, the protocol has been slightly simplified from the actual Swapchat implementation. Many further security measures may be taken to make the process much more secure. Trojan chunks can be used to create a zero-leak version of the protocol by performing the intial exchange of public keys.

### Swapchat Protocol

1. Alicia creates two key pairs, A and S.
2. Alicia creates S_SOC_0 containing her public key.
3. Alicia then transmits a message to Barbara containing the private key of feed S, S_Priv
4. Alicia now polls to see if the SOC at index 1 exists, S_SOC_1.
5. Barbara receives the private key S_Priv and uses it to retrieve A_Pub from S_SOC_0.
6. Barbara creates a new key pair B, B_Pub and B_Priv
7. Barbara uses S_Priv to create S_SOC_1 with a payload consisting of B_Pub.
8. Alicia notices that S_SOC_1 has been created and retrieves it's payload, B_Pub.
9. Alicia and Barbara now seperately create the diffie-hellman shared secret of A and B - DiffHell_AB
10. Alicia and Barbara are now 'connected', Alicia polls for B_SOC_0 and Barbara polls for A_SOC_0
11. Alicia uploads A_SOC_0 with a message payload encrypted with secret DiffHell_AB.
12. This is retreived by Barbara who has been polling for chunk A_SOC_0 at an address determined by A_Pub.
13. Barbara decrypts the payload of the chunk using DiffHell_AB and consumes the message plaintext.
14. Barbara now polls for A_SOC_1, Alicia remembers her next message index will be 1.
15. Barbara creates chunks B_SOC_0 and B_SOC_1 with her message responses, encrypted with DiffHell_AB and uploads them to the network.
16. Alicia notices B_SOC_0 has been created, retrieves it.
17. Alicia now polls for B_SOC_1 and notices this has also been created and retrieves it for decryption.
17. And so on...

### Swapchat Example

For this demo we will start with Alicia's client, she will initiate the chat.

To keep things simple, we will only cover the swarm.js code, and assume any user interface code to be outside the scope of this tutorial.

In Alicia's client, let's create two key pairs A and B. We'll use the first one later to send messages. Now we'll use the second one to perform the handshake and poll the shared feed S's first SOC in the sequence so that we can then construct the shared secret.

```js
let topic = 'swapchat';

let swarmA = new Swarm(salt, {wallet: {type: 'localhost', namespace: 'A'}});
let swarmS = new SwarmBS(salt, {wallet: {type: 'localhost', namespace: 'S'}});

let pollForHandshake = async (swarmA, swarmS) => {
	let handshake = new swarmS.soc();
	setInterval(async () => {
		try{
			let handshakeSOC = await handshake.download(); //default index 0
			let B_Pub = handshakeSOC.payload();
			resolve(B_Pub);
		}catch(e){
			if(e.status.code === 404){
				//do nothing
			}else{
				throw new Error(e);
			}
		}
	}, 1000);
};

let B_Pub = await pollForHandshake(swarmA, swarmS);

/// continued below...
```

In Barbara's client, we take the private key S_Priv which has been delivered by a secure channel, and create the first SOC in the integer sequence that Alicia is currently polling for.

```js
let topic = 'swapchat';
let A_Addr = 'abcd....';
let S_Priv = 'abcd....';



let swarmB = new Swarm(salt, {wallet: {type: 'localhost', namespace: 'A'}});
let swarmS = new SwarmBS(topic, {wallet: {type: 'localhost', namespace: 'S', privateKey: S_Priv}});

let handshake = new swarmS.soc(); //single owner chunk collection, Uint indexed, salt is 0x, we are starting at 0 (no previous index to add), it is the owners block
let handshakeSOC = await handshake.upload(swarmB.wallet.publicKey()); //default index 0


let sharedSecret = diffieHellman(swarmB.wallet.privateKey, S_Priv);

let pollForMessageFromA = async (addrA, swarmB, secret, i = 0) => {
	let messageA = new swarmB.soc({ user: addrA });
	setInterval(async () => {
		try{
			let messageASOC = await messageA.download(i); //default index 0
		}catch(e){
			if(e.status.code === 404){
				//do nothing
			}else{
				throw new Error(e);
			}
		}
	}, 1000);
};

// poll for next expected chunk in feed A
// if successful, add to the array and increment the index
// otherwise if 404 do nothing and try again after some delay
let messagesA = [];
let messagesAIndex = 0;
setInterval(async ()=>{
	try{
		let message = await pollForMessageFromA(A_Addr, swarmB, sharedSecret, messagesAIndex);
		//success
		messagesA.push(message);
		messagesAIndex = messagesAIndex++;
	}catch(e){
		if(e.status.code === 404){
			//do nothing
		}else{
			throw new Error(e);
		}
	}
}, 1000);
``` 

Now, back in Alicia's client, we will have succesfully polled for the handshake, we can now retrieve Barbara's public key, and construct the shared a secret and expected location of Alicia's messages. We then set up polling for Barabara's message SOC's.

```js
// ...continued from Alicia's initialisation above
let B_Pub = await pollForHandshake(swarmA, swarmS);
let sharedSecret = diffieHellman(swarmS.wallet.privateKey, B_Pub);
let B_Addr = addressFromPubKey(B_Pub);
//success, we are connected!


let pollForMessageFromB = async (addrB, swarmA, secret, i = 0) => {
	let messageA = new swarmA.soc({ user: addrB });
	setInterval(async () => {
		try{
			let messageBSOC = await messageA.download(i);
		}catch(e){
			if(e.status.code === 404){
				//do nothing
			}else{
				throw new Error(e);
			}
		}
	}, 1000);
};

// poll for next expected chunk in feed B
// if successful, add to the array and increment the index
// otherwise if 404 do nothing and try again after some delay
let messagesB = [];
let messagesBIndex = 0;
setInterval(async ()=>{
	try{
		let message = await pollForMessageFromB(B_Addr, swarmA, sharedSecret, messagesAIndex);
		//success
		messagesB.push(message);
		messagesBIndex = messagesAIndex++;
	}catch(e){
		if(e.status.code === 404){
			//do nothing
		}else{
			throw new Error(e);
		}
	}
}, 1000);
```
