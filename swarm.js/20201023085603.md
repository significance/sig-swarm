Trojan Chunks are designed for leak proof communications. 

Here we'll show how to use swarm.js to produce a very naive and simple chat app that allows comms between two Swarm addresses.

Andy initiates a chat with Brian. Andy has already exchanged the topic id and his public key off band.

First Andy will set up a listener to check chunks in the neighbourhood to see if each of them is a Trojan chunk.

```js
let pubKeyB = "a123...4fde"

let swarmA = SwarmA();
let trojA = new swarmA.trojan(pubKeyB, 'trojan-chat-brian-andy-9234823', {
	time: new Date(), 
	message: "Hello Bzz Bzzzz Bzz Brian"
});
await trojA.upload();

let pssA = new swarmA.pss('trojan-chat-brian-andy-9234823');

pss.on('received', (troj) => {
	console.log(`message received from Andy at ${troj.time}: ${troj.message}`);
});
```

```js
let trojA = new swarmA.trojan(pubKeyA, 'trojan-chat-brian-andy-9234823', {
	time: new Date(), 
	message: "Hello Bzz Bzzzz Bzz Brian".
});
await trojA.upload();

let swarmB = SwarmB();

let pssB = new swarmB.pss('trojan-chat-brian-andy-9234823');

pssB.on('received', (troj) => {
	console.log(troj.time, troj.message);
});
```
