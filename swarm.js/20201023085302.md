### Abstract

* a wall of fame shows a list of names and associated ethereum addresses
* each member of the wall of fame must nominate the next
* the creator of the wall of fame nominates the first member
* in this way, we create a chain of chunks which represents a consensus
* in pt 2 we will make it secure by adding a consensus check

* to nominate a member, the nomintor must first acquire the nominee's ethereum address
* to keep everything simple, the nominator will assign the nominee's legend
* it's not perfect, but it is ideal

### Initialisation

To create the WOF let's a add a Single Owner Chunk which will represent the 'genesis' chunk. This is the first chunk of the chain and contains the nomination for the first nominee consisting of a legend and an Ethereum address.

First initialise the Swarm object. We will use a salt to make sure there are not collisions with any other address spaces.

```js
let swarm = new Swarm({
    salt: "sigs-leet-wall-of-fame",
    wallet: "metamask"
});
console.log(swarm.wallet.address);
```

Let's create a Single Owner Chunk as the genesis chunk, the address of this will be hardcoded so we will take a note of it for later on. We will use an Ethereum address Rpicc has the private key material for, and has provided to Sig off band.

```js
let gSocCollection = new swarm.soc('1337', {
    encryption: 'none'
});

let gSoc = gSocCollection.upload({
    nominated_address: 'a7417...',
    nominated_legend: "RPICC"
});
console.log(gSoc.address);
```

```sh
b4de711c...
```

Notice we have specified that encryption is turned off. Single Owner Chunk collections by default have x3dh encryption enabled, in this case our information is intended to be public, so we will turn it off.

Then we use the upload function to create a single owner chunk at position 0 for topic '1337' using the standard incremented integers indexing scheme.

Now, since everyone on this board especially Rpicc will be super leet, they may nominations using only the command line. Rpicc will add Zelig the board using an Ethereum address Zelig is know to control.

```js

let swarm = new Swarm({
    salt: "sigs-leet-wall-of-fame",
    wallet: "metamask"
});

let gSocCollection = new swarm.soc('1337', {
    encryption: 'none'
});

let gSoc = gSocCollection.upload({
    nominated_address: '7e116...',
    nominated_legend: "ZELIG"
});
```

For less elite wall of fame users, we could easily add a simple javascript form.

Next we will write the code which will check whether the chunks comprising the Wall of Fame posts exist yet, and display them if they do.

The address of the genesis chunk is already known, so we will use that to retrieve the payload and get Rpicc's nomination

```js
let wofs = [];

let swarm = new Swarm({
    salt: "sigs-leet-wall-of-fame",
    wallet: "none"
});

let genChunkAddress = 'b4de711c...';

let gSoc = await swarm.download(genChunkAddress);

wofs.push([gSoc.nominated_address, gSoc.nominated_legend]);

let recurseThroughWofs = (wofs) => {
    let wofOwner = wofs[wofs.length - 1][0];
    let wofSoc = new swarm.SOC('1337',{
        owner: wofOwner
    });
    
    try{
        let wofNomSoc = await wofSoc.at(0);
    }catch(e){
        if(e.status.code === 404){
            return wofs;
        }else{
            throw new Error(e);
        }
    }
    wofs.push([wofNomSoc.nominated_address, wofNomSoc.nominated_legend]);
    recurseThroughWofs(wofs);
};

wofs = recurseThroughWofs(wofs);
console.log(wofs);
```

```js
[
    [['RPICC'],['a7417...']],
    [['ZELIG'],['7e116...']]
]
```
