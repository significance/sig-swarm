title:  HTTP Gateway's and Bee Proxies
---

Traditionally, there has been a conceptual distinction between the HTTP gateway api interface and the wire-protocol level interface, but these have become increasingly blurred. The current API provides a chunk level interface to allow chunks to be constructed in the browser, then pushed piecewise into the swarm.

It is instructive to extend the definition of a node is extended to include any actor interacting with the network. Here, applications, such as javascript programs running in a browser, or a python program sending requests to the Admin API may be conceived of as simply nodes with a subset of functionality to that of Bee, and that interact with Bee nodes specifically, using http/ws transport and the protocol defined by the API specifications rather than the Swarm Protocol per se.

#### Gateway API

Supplies services to non libp2p capable nodes* on the internet.

We can now think of HTTP Gateways as "edge nodes" which are responsible for providing services that for individuals or applications that have so far failed to overcome the hurdle of becoming truly p2p and running a bidirectional wire protocol. This will be particularly necessary for langauges not catered for by the libp2p toolset.

One could conceive of gateway nodes being more profitable than normal Bee nodes, perhaps charging a premium for forwarding services, or by providing access to edge caching services for content specific to an application or purpose, for example open street maps tiles. The advantage over  traditional web2 services being that there is no overhead of developer knowledge and infrastructure needed to be able to supply the cached content, which is accesible from the network simply with retrieval and caching.

#### Admin API

Allows users to interact with the Bee software itself.

The Admin API now is very simply just a means of interacting with the Bee software. When a Bee node is run, users may interact with it using command line networking tools such as curl, a http gui api, or other applications running in a local network.

Note that some functionality would be available in both API's, but that for the Gateway API an additional payment layer must be satisfied so that the Gateway nodes may be remunerated for their services.

#### Debug API

The debug API can now be left for access for API endpoints only required when debugging or developing an instance of the Bee application.
