title: Beacon Chunks
---

q: is it more efficient to calculate trojan chunks from soc's? has the advantage they are owned authetically
g: if some node are receiving a disproportionate amount of chunks, does this affect the axiomatic assumtion of a uniformly distributed network?

Beacon Chunks are a special kind of chunk that can be mined by a key owner in a way that they are guaranteed to appear in the network at a certain place. In this sense they are analogous to Trojan chunks, but these chunks do not seek subterfuge. Instead, they have an opposite purpose, signaling the intention of joining an aggregated feed.

In the same way as Self Addressed Envelopes in Swarm are mined by generating a chunk address to be within a byte prefix neighbourhood context, Beacon chunks can choose where they are stored in the network.

Beacon chunks then borrow from Trojan chunks by having an identifyable and specific payload. This may be application specific, but typically consists of a statistally significant magic byte sequence preceeding the payload.

// Trojan chunks can also be used for a similar purpose, but the disadvantage is they can only be determined by possesion or ability to filter all the chunks in the relevant neighbourhood to check whether they produce a decryptable result. This imposes high computation and bandwidth overheads which are undesirable in most cases, and particularly those where security is not a requirement since the data is fully or partially intended to be published. To respond to this requirement, Beacon chunks voluntarily leak some or all of the data and meta data in order to allow storage nodes to respond to filtered queries for specific sets of chunks. 

Beacon chunks can also have additional encryption to ensure 

A node is then able to query it's chunk store to determine the existence of any such chunks. In the case these chunks do exist, they are then processed at the application level to retain information delivered and stored in a cryptographically provable way by the rest of the swarm.

### Example: Aggregated Feeds

A typical problem in web development is the need to add a comment to a thread of replies to a post. Each post and reply must be authentic in the sense it can only have been produced by the author of the post. In a traditional client/server situation, this integrity is guaranteed by a third party - the application owner. However, in a decentralised setting we must use cryptography.

In Swarm, such a scenario is characterised as the aggregation of many feeds of single owner chunks which follow a predictable schema and can therefore be reassembled at will by anyone in the network with knowledge of the addressing scheme and aggregation protocol. This scheme is elegant and simplistic, but it does leave one question - whom's feeds should I aggregate?

A typical means of solving this is to use a global blockchain, and indeed a blockchain such as the Ethereum network does provide not only a virtually cast iron guarantee of integrity without having to divest trust to any single party (thanks Satoshi!) but also turing complete means of defining these rules. For simplistic and less globally important scenarios such as the one detailed above, however, the overhead involved is superflous in expense so we continue to seek other means.

To keep it super simple, our entire website will consist of one post and some replies that are displayed in lexiographical order.

Let's make the soc using a simple json blob, we can do this using the node and the swarm.js library.

```sh
npm i --global swarm.js
node
```

```js
let Swarm = require('swarm.js');

let salt = "Bee Corner";

let doc = {
  post: "Hello Swarm Bzzz Bzz Bzzz"
}

let poster = new Swarm();
let posterSoc = poster.soc({salt});

let address = await posterSoc.create(doc);

console.log(address);

```

Here, we are specifying a salt to differentiate our chunks from the reset of the network, but we do not need to place it in any particular neighbourhood.

```

We will later hard code this chunk address into our retrieval protocol, which we will once again be verified when releasing the code that defines and implements this protocol using either content addressed or the single owner chunks.

Next, let's create a reply to our initial post using a Beacon chunk. This time, notice we are specifying a two byte prefix. 

```js
let Swarm = require('swarm.js');

let salt = "Bee Corner";

let prefix = "1337";

let doc = {
  reply: "What's Up My Bee Bzzz Bzz Bzzz"
}

let poster = new Swarm();
let posterSoc = poster.soc({salt, prefix});

let address = await posterSoc.create(doc);

console.log(address);

```

```
1ee787e8804e9320769ab81ee4848c2c2eb9cfb45fd49e18de821c2b50a6de23
```

You are encouraged to generate a few more responses here!

:::info
Note that we did not need to specify the magic byte prefix mentioned above. Swarm.js has default behaviour built in that uses the SOC salt and prefix to generate the magic bytes unless we specify something different in the SOC sequence generator's config.
:::

Finally, let's put all this together to produce the javascript that will render the post and it's replies.

```js
let Swarm = require('swarm.js');

let salt = "Bee Corner";
let prefix = "1337";

let post 

let swarm = new Swarm();
let postChunk = new swarm.chunk('1ee787e8804e9320769ab81ee4848c2c2eb9cfb45fd49e18de821c2b50a6de23');
await postChunk.download();

console.log("POST ---");
console.log(postChunk.post);
console.log("--- POST");

let replySOC = new swarm.SOC({salt, prefix});
replySOC.fetch();
//queries range for magic bytes in prefix neighbourhood

let replys = [];
for(replySOC.chunks() as chunk){
  let address = chunk.address; //owner
  let reply  = chunk.reply; //json chunks automagically parsed by swarm.js
  let index  = chunk.index; //there might be more than one per user

  replys.push(reply);

  assert(chunk.indexScheme === 'uint'); //json chunks automagically parsed by swarm.js
}

replys.sort().each((rep)=>{
  console.log("REPLY ---");	
  console.log(rep)
  console.log("--- REPLY");
});

```

```

Yes Bee! What you sayin Bee Bzzz Bzz Bzzz
--- REPLY
```


nb. is mining single owner a chunks a DOS vector we need to mitigate in the protocol?




// BEACON BLOCKS

	// TROJAN BLOCKS WHICH ARE NOT ENCRYPTED
	// THESE BLOCKS ARE USED TO **PUBLICLY ADVERTISE THINGS**
	// THESE BLOCKS **HAVE INBUILT POW**
	// THESE BLOCKS CAN BE USED TO **JOIN LISTS**
	// THESE BLOCKS CAN BE USED TO **CREATE BLOCKCHAINS**
	// THESE BLOCKS ARE SIGNED

		//reliable and useful messages for the user
		//basic and low barrier to entry
		//power users should be able to go much further

// is it sensible for neighbourhoods to conspire together to lie about beacon blocks? can they? not if they are signed?
