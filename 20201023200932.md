// CODENAME SWIANA

	// SWIANA provides a centralised registry for where to find things for each address
	// the intention is to provide a means of the app devs being able to immediately access certain elements of knowledge for a particualar ID
	// SWIANA need to not be used in all cases, but in cases where the address is intended to interact with SWIANA compliant entities, it may already be known the location of many entities

	// Topics to be assigned on a first come first serve basis except for those in reserved blocks for public interest utilities
	// Reserved blocks to be determined by accumulation of voting stake. 
	// voting stake to be proof of sybil attack, incapable of undermining with financial collateral and to be determined by logical and democratic means of open discussion.
	
	// Left zero padding to be assumed.
	// 0x0 to be public key of address if wanted to be known
	// 0x1 to be human readable indentity if wanted to be known (for the purposes of informing others `verbally` of a username or handle)

	// other possible uses
	// pointers to information exceeding 1 chunk (is this still needed?)
	// rdf collateral relating to identity
	// specific identity ids for other platforms eg. openauth, github handles (this will allow us to later write personal data scraping harvesters for individuals)
	// other public key material eg. PGP keys
	// location of personal home page
	// location of other data one would like to be public
	// if a business, location of trading premises
	// revoked key material
	// authorised key material
